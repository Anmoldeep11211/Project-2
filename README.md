# Project-2
In this code:

draw_petal is a function that creates a single petal using half-circles.
draw_flower sets up the window, creates a Turtle object, and uses draw_petal in a loop to create the flower.
The flower consists of 6 petals (you can change number_of_petals to increase or decrease the petals).
After drawing the petals, the code adds a circle at the center to represent the flower's center.
Colors and sizes can be modified for different effects.
